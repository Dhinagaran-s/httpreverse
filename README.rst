Reverse-engineer legacy HTTP APIs.

This package was born of a need to wrap a lot of different kinds of existing,
undocumented legacy HTTP APIs not following any kind of consistent, well
planned design, and to add a little bit of documentation to have some idea
what those legacy APIs do.

This package is NOT meant for defining new APIs. Use e.g. Swagger for that.
